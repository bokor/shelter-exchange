			<h4>Donate items</h4> 
			<p>Shelters always need items for their animals such as food, treats, blankets and toys. Find the group below you wish to support and click to view their Wish list to see which items they need the most.</p>
			
			<h4>Adopt</h4> 
			<p>Animals at your local shelter need your help! View a list of adoptable animals by clicking the Save a Life tab above. Search by a specific shelter name or use the interactive map to find animals close by.</p>
			
			<h4>Foster</h4> 
			<p>Many animals need temporary foster homes because there is a lack of space at the shelter. Consider opening your home to an animal in need for a few weeks, the experience is very rewarding.</p>
