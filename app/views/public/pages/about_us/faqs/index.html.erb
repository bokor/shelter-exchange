	<h1>FAQs</h1>

	<p>Below are some questions and answers we have prepared to navigate you through our organization, and to provide a deeper understanding of our application and how we plan to provide this service to shelters and rescue groups.</p>

	<ul class="list">
		<li>
			<span>1</span>
			<h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
			<p>The Shelter Exchange application is free of charge. Our application has been developed specifically for the animal welfare community to reduce the number of animals that will be euthanized. We chose to form Shelter Exchange as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization so we can support the cost through fundraising, donations and sponsorships. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>2</span>
			<h3>Who can use the Shelter Exchange application?</h3>
			<p>We have designed the application for the entire animal welfare industry. Animal rescue groups, animal shelters and municipal facilities are all welcome to sign up to use Shelter Exchange.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>3</span>
			<h3>Who cannot use the application?</h3>
			<p>Breeders are excluded; and the general public cannot use the application. This is designed specifically for shelters and rescues. We understand there may be certain exceptions for individuals heavily involved with animal welfare or rescue; these will be reviewed on an individual basis as they arise.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>4</span>
			<h3>What do you mean when you say 'application'?</h3>
			<p>By application we mean the software that stores information about animals in shelters and rescue facilities on secure servers and is accessed online with a log in. All shelters and rescue groups that use Shelter Exchange can then view the animal data and submit requests to transfer animals from shelters to rescue facilities. All data is highly secure and password protected.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>5</span>
			<h3>I am a rescue but we do not have a 501(c)(3) status, can I still use the application?</h3>
			<p>Yes, but there may be a few additional questions and information required from you. We are very careful not to allow unscrupulous individuals or groups to have access to this information. The information contained in Shelter Exchange is designed specifically for shelters and rescue groups.</p>

			<h3> How can I help Shelter Exchange with their mission?</h3>

			<p>Our role is to fund the application for shelters and rescues and ensure it remains free of charge. Every month we require financial donations to continue these efforts and to allow more shelters and rescues to sign up. If you would like to help, <a href="/donate">please consider donating to our cause</a></p>
