	<p>Donors and sponsors are an essential component to providing Shelter Exchange the ability to continue our life saving work. Generous donations allow us to provide shelters and rescue groups with a no-cost application to help increase efficiency at their facilities, giving them more time to effectively connect with rescue groups to save more animals that otherwise will face the sad fate of euthanasia.</p> 

	<p>With the support of donors and sponsors we can change a broken system that is failing millions of innocent animals each year across the country. The Shelter Exchange application directly addresses and resolves the challenges that contribute to the issue of widespread animal euthanasia in shelters. Supporting a practical solution for positive change, together we can make the most difference to the greatest number of animals.</p>  

	<p>Please <a href="/donate">donate now</a> if you would like to help our mission. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization; all donations are 100% tax deductible.</p>

	<p>If not you, who? If not now, when?</p>
