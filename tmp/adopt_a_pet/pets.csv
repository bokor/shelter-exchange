786,Farm Animal,Alpaca,,aaaabb,M,"<p>Coco came to Fuzzy Pawz rescue as a stray found in the Boise, Idaho area by 2 wonderful citizens that took her in and kept her safe until we could come and get her to be placed in a foster home. Coco is a half Chihuahua and mini Dachshund mix; she has a smooth sable colored coat and is about 2 years old. Coco is current on her shots and has been spayed.</p>

<p>Coco is potty trained and crate trained and comes when you call her. Coco loves to go for walks and rides in the car. Coco sleeps all night in her crate and will go to her crate even for a nap during the day. Coco has had her dental and she had some troubles with walking when we first got her, we think she was clipped by a car the night she was found. She is fully recovered and doing great.</p>

<p>Coco is a typical Chi mix and will let you know when someone is at the door or close to her yard. She warms quickly with the right introduction and will give you kisses and bring you her toy to play fetch after you have made friends with her. Coco is loyal and a real cuddle bug. She has a sweet and silly personality and looks at you with loving eyes when you talk to her and give her attention. She takes treats gently from your hand.</p>

<p>Coco will need to go to a home with no small children (kids over 15 are fine); due to her previous back injury and her size she needs a gentle touch. Coco would be a great travel companion and would also make a great companion to someone who wants a buddy to sit in their lap during the day. Coco would be a great travel companion and would also make a great companion to someone who wants a buddy to sit in their lap during the day. Coco would be a great family dog too; she loves my girls and is all excited to play with them. Coco loves both men and women and seems especially fond of my husband when he comes home from work she is so excited to see him.</p>

<p>Coco is only 7lbs. and is a tiny little girl. Coco loves to play and snoop around in the yard just like a bigger breed dog. Coco needs daily exercise and a loving family that will give her continued socialization as all dogs need this to be a balanced member of the family. Coco would do best in a home that has a dog or cat larger than her as she feels she is the queen like most chi's and doxie's do and she will need a home that is on the quieter side as she gets overwhelmed by a lot of chaos as most chi's and doxies do.</p>

<p>If Coco sounds like a good fit for your family give her foster mom Lisa a call at 208-409-7006 or fill out the adoption application for coco at <a href=""http://www.fuzzypawzrescue.com"" target=""_blank"">www.fuzzypawzrescue.com</a>.</p>

<p>Coco's adoption fee is $40 plus the cost of her spay and shots.</p><br /><br /><a href='http://www.shelterexchange.org/save_a_life/786'>aaaabb, Alpaca Mix</a> has been shared from <a href='http://www.shelterexchange.org'>Shelter Exchange</a>.<link rel='canonical' href='http://www.shelterexchange.org/save_a_life/786' />",Available,,Y,S,,http://s3.amazonaws.com/shelterexchange-development/animals/photos/786/large/mini_sunset_200x200.jpg?1333396249,
